# BrightByte Internal Tools Repository

Welcome to the BrightByte team!

This repository serves as the central hub for utility scripts and tools shared by the Data Technician team. We use version control to ensure our tools are safe, trackable, and collaborative.

## Repository Structure

Currently, this repository holds basic onboarding scripts. As the team grows, we will add more complex data processing tools here.
